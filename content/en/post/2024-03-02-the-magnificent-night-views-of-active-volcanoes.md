## Backdrop: Active Volcanoes Around the World

### Differences between active, dormant, and extinct volcanoes

When it comes to volcanoes, it is important to understand the differences between active, dormant, and extinct volcanoes. Active volcanoes are those that have erupted recently or are currently experiencing volcanic activity. These volcanoes pose the highest risk as they have the potential to erupt at any time. Dormant volcanoes, on the other hand, are classified as volcanoes that have not erupted in a long time but have the potential to become active again in the future. Finally, extinct volcanoes are those that have not erupted for thousands of years and are not expected to erupt again.

### Frequency and distribution of active volcanoes worldwide

Active volcanoes can be found all around the world, but their frequency and distribution vary depending on the tectonic plate boundaries and hotspots. The Pacific Ring of Fire, an area surrounding the Pacific Ocean, is the most well-known hotspot for volcanic activity, with approximately 75% of the world's active volcanoes located within its boundaries. Other areas with significant volcanic activity include the Mediterranean region, East Africa, and parts of Central and South America. It is important to note that volcanic activity can change over time, with previously dormant volcanoes becoming active and vice versa.

### Major tectonic plate boundaries and hotspots for volcanic activity

The major tectonic plate boundaries and hotspots play a crucial role in determining the locations of active volcanoes. There are several types of plate boundaries, including convergent boundaries where two plates collide, divergent boundaries where two plates move apart, and transform boundaries where two plates slide past each other. Convergent plate boundaries, such as the subduction zones in the Pacific Ring of Fire, are known for their explosive volcanic activity due to the subduction of one tectonic plate beneath another. Hotspots, on the other hand, are areas of volcanic activity that are not directly related to plate boundaries. Instead, they are thought to be caused by plumes of hot material rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. These hotspots can create chains of volcanic islands, like the Hawaiian Islands.
