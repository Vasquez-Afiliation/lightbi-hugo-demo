Shishaldin Volcano: Alaska's Restless Giant

Kilauea: Fire, Fury, and the Hidden Dangers of Volcanic Gas 

# Kilauea: Fire, Fury, and the Hidden Dangers of Volcanic Gas

Kilauea Volcano, on the Big Island of Hawai'i, is a force of nature that mesmerizes all who witness it. Rivers of molten rock glow crimson against the night sky, a primal reminder of our planet's fiery heart. Visitors flock to witness this spectacle, drawn by Kilauea's undeniable allure. Yet, behind the mesmerizing displays of lava lies a more subtle danger – one that's often invisible to the naked eye.

## The Beauty and the Beast

Like many of Earth's volcanoes, Kilauea is a study in contrasts. It creates while it destroys, its eruptions both awe-inspiring and potentially devastating. Beyond the spectacle of lava flows and fountains lies a hidden threat: volcanic gas. Deep within the volcano's fiery depths, a chemical cocktail brews, and at its heart lies [sulfur dioxide](https://magmamatters.com/the-art-and-science-of-volcano-monitoring/ "The Art and Science of Volcano Monitoring") (SO2).

## Sulfur Dioxide: The Invisible Threat

Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and for those with respiratory conditions like asthma, it can be particularly dangerous. When volcanoes like Kilauea erupt, they release vast amounts of SO2 into the atmosphere. This gas reacts with sunlight, moisture, and other particles, creating a hazy, acidic pollution known as 'vog.'

Vog is often a much larger concern than the lava flows of Hawaii's active volcanoes. While the glowing rivers of lava are relatively localized, vog can drift for hundreds of miles, affecting air quality across broad areas. Kilauea typically emits between 500 and 14,000 metric tons of SO2 every single day, but during major eruptions, those numbers can skyrocket. In 2018, Kilauea spewed out over 100,000 metric tons of SO2 daily – enough to fill thousands of Olympic swimming pools. [\[2\]](https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/science/faqs)

For visitors and residents of the Hawaiian Islands, vog brings serious health concerns. Prolonged exposure can trigger asthma attacks, worsen respiratory conditions, and cause headaches, fatigue, and a sore throat. Vog's acidic nature also damages crops, harms ecosystems, and corrodes infrastructure. \[3\]

## Monitoring for Safety

Understanding the risks posed by volcanic gas is critical for safety, which is why organizations like the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) play a vital role. [\[4\]](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo) Scientists with the HVO constantly monitor Kilauea's emissions, using a combination of ground-based instruments and satellites. This data provides valuable insights into volcanic activity, enabling officials to issue air quality warnings and take steps to protect public health.

## Respecting the Power

Kilauea's fiery beauty is undeniable. However, it is this raw power that demands both our awe and our caution. Volcanic gas is a potent reminder that while these geological wonders are fascinating subjects of study, they must be approached with respect and an understanding of their inherent risks.

Here are several tips to keep in mind if you're visiting areas near active volcanoes:

- **Stay Informed:** Check with park officials and the USGS Volcano Hazards Program for the latest information about activity levels and potential hazards. \[5\]
- **Heed Warnings:** Pay attention to air quality alerts and advisories about vog. Reduce outdoor activities when air quality is poor.
- **Protect Yourself:** If you have a respiratory condition, bring your medication with you. Consider wearing a mask rated N95 or better on days with heavy vog. [\[6\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)
- **Observe from a Distance:** Admire volcanic activity from designated viewing areas. Don't venture into restricted zones or attempt to approach lava flows.
