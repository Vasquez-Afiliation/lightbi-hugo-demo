## Definition and Basics of Volcanic Rocks

Volcanic rocks are formed through volcanic activity, which occurs when molten rock, gases, and debris escape to the Earth's surface. These rocks are primarily composed of solidified lava and volcanic ash. There are three main types of volcanic rocks: basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.

1. Basalt: Basaltic rocks are dark in color and have a fine-grained texture. They are rich in iron and magnesium, and are commonly found in areas where volcanic eruptions have occurred. Basaltic lava flows are characterized by their low viscosity, which allows them to spread quickly over large areas.
    
2. Andesite: Andesitic rocks have a medium-grained texture and are typically gray or brown in color. They are composed of a mixture of minerals, including plagioclase feldspar and mafic minerals. Andesitic lava flows are known for their medium viscosity, which allows them to flow at a slower pace compared to basaltic lava.
    
3. Rhyolite: Rhyolitic rocks have a light-colored appearance and a fine-grained or glassy texture. They are rich in silica and are associated with explosive volcanic eruptions. Rhyolitic lavas are highly viscous, which means they tend to flow slowly and build up near the vent.
    

The composition and texture of volcanic rocks are influenced by the type of magma from which they are derived. Magma composition is determined by factors such as the composition of the Earth's mantle and the degree of partial melting during volcanic activity. The formation process of volcanic rocks involves the cooling and solidification of magma or lava, either above or below the Earth's surface.
