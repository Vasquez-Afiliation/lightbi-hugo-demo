Soaring over these majestic natural wonders gives you a true sense of their size and magnificence.

### Access to inaccessible areas

Volcanoes often have rugged and inaccessible terrain, making it difficult to explore them on foot. However, with a helicopter tour, you can access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. This allows you to get up close and personal with the volcano, flying over its craters, slopes, and lava flows that would otherwise be off-limits. You can explore hidden pockets of beauty that are only visible from the air.

### Thrill of flying close to an active volcano

The thrill of flying close to an active volcano is an experience like no other. As you hover above the volcanic crater, you can feel the heat and power emanating from the earth below. The sight of bubbling lava, plumes of ash, and the raw energy of a live volcano is something that stays with you forever. It's an adrenaline-pumping adventure that combines the excitement of flight with the awe-inspiring spectacle of volcanic activity.

If witnessing volcanic activity is your main goal, it's best to plan your helicopter tour during a period of active eruptions. While volcanic eruptions are unpredictable, staying updated with the latest information from monitoring agencies can help you make an informed decision. By being at the right place at the right time, you can increase your chances of witnessing the awe-inspiring spectacle of a live volcano.

### Time of day recommendation for optimal visibility

The time of day can greatly impact the visibility and overall experience during a volcano helicopter tour. Generally, early mornings and late afternoons tend to offer the best lighting conditions for photography, as the sun is lower in the sky. Additionally, these times often provide a more serene and peaceful atmosphere as opposed to the bustling midday hours.

### Best season for tours

Depending on the location, the best season to go on a volcano helicopter tour can vary. Consider factors such as weather conditions, accessibility, and local volcanic activity patterns when planning your trip. Researching the region's climatic patterns and consulting with tour operators can help you choose the ideal time to embark on your volcano adventure.

## Preparation for Volcano Helicopter Tours

Proper preparation is key to ensuring your comfort and safety during a volcano helicopter tour. Here are some tips to help you prepare:

### Dressing for comfort and safety

Wearing comfortable clothing and sturdy footwear is essential for a helicopter tour. Opt for lightweight and breathable materials that allow freedom of movement. Additionally, consider packing layers to accommodate changes in temperature during the flight. Don't forget to bring a hat and sunscreen for protection against the sun's rays.

### What to bring on the tour

When preparing for a volcano helicopter tour, it's important to pack essential items. These may include a camera or smartphone for capturing the breathtaking views, a water bottle to stay hydrated, and any necessary medications or personal items. Be sure to check with the tour operator for any specific recommendations based on the duration and location of the tour.

## Photography Tips on Volcano Helicopter Tours

Capturing the beauty and power of volcanoes through photography can be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips to help you enhance your photography skills during a volcano helicopter tour:

### Camera gear recommendation

A volcano helicopter tour provides a mix of majestic landscapes, close-up shots of volcanic activity, and fast-moving aerial scenes. To capture these moments effectively, it's recommended to bring a camera with a versatile zoom lens. A wide-angle lens can help capture the vastness of the landscape, while a telephoto lens can be useful for zooming in on specific details or lava flows.

### Capturing lava flows and eruptions

When photographing lava flows and eruptions, consider using a fast shutter speed to freeze the motion and capture the details. Experiment with different exposure settings to capture the glow and intensity of the lava. It's also recommended to use a tripod or stabilization system to ensure sharp images, as the helicopter's vibrations can cause camera shake.

### Positioning for best lighting

The position of the helicopter can greatly affect the lighting conditions for photography. Communicate with the pilot or guide to position the helicopter in a way that maximizes the lighting and minimizes shadows. The angle at which the sunlight hits the landscape can greatly enhance the textures and details in your photos, so be sure to take advantage of the best angles available.
