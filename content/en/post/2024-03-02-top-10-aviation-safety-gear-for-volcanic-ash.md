## Purpose and mechanism of HEPA filters

HEPA filters are designed to remove extremely small particles from the air, including dust, pollen, mold spores, and even bacteria. These filters are made up of multiple layers of fine fibers that capture particles as air passes through them. The mechanism behind HEPA filters involves three main processes: interception, impaction, and diffusion. In interception, larger particles collide with the filter fibers and become trapped. In impaction, smaller particles follow the air stream and collide with the fibers, also becoming trapped. Lastly, in diffusion, the smallest particles are slowed down by the airflow, causing them to collide with the filter fibers and be captured. This combination of processes makes HEPA filters highly effective in removing airborne particles.
