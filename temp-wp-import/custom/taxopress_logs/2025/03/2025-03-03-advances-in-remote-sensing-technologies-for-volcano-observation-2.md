## Tracking Volcano Movements With Satellites

Utilizing advanced satellite technology, scientists track volcano movements by detecting thermal anomalies and changes in surface temperature. This method enables continuous monitoring of volcanic regions, providing crucial data on volcanic activity and eruption dynamics. By integrating remote sensing instruments like MODIS and AVHRR, researchers can analyze ground deformation, magma migration, and other precursory signals of eruptions.

Here are three key aspects of tracking volcano movements with satellites:

1. **Thermal Anomalies Detection**: Satellites can identify hot spots or areas of increased thermal activity on the volcano's surface. These anomalies often indicate rising magma or potential eruption sites, aiding in early warning systems for volcanic hazards.
2. **Surface Temperature Changes**: Monitoring changes in surface temperature helps scientists understand the evolving conditions within and around a volcano. Slight variations can signify alterations in volcanic activity levels, providing insights into the internal processes at play.
3. **Enhanced Volcano Monitoring**: Satellite technology enhances traditional ground-based volcano monitoring by offering a broader perspective and real-time data collection. This integration improves the overall understanding of volcano behavior, evolution, and potential risks to surrounding areas.

## Operational Use of Mirova for Volcano Monitoring

Enhancing volcanic surveillance through the operational implementation of the MIROVA system revolutionizes real-time monitoring capabilities worldwide. By utilizing space-based data and remote sensing technology, MIROVA automatically detects, locates, and quantifies thermal anomalies at over 200 volcanoes globally. This daily monitoring of high-temperature thermal anomalies greatly aids in understanding volcanic activity and assessing potential hazards.
