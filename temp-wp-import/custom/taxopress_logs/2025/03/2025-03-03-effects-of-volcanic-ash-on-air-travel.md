## Properties of Volcanic Ash

### Composition of volcanic ash

Volcanic ash is composed of small particles of fragmented volcanic rock, mineral crystals, and volcanic glass that are ejected into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. The composition of [volcanic ash varies depending on the type of volcano](https://magmamatters.com/understanding-volcanic-formation-a-comprehensive-guide/ "Understanding Volcanic Formation: A Comprehensive Guide") and the characteristics of the erupted magma. The ash can contain a mixture of silica, aluminum, iron, calcium, and other elements.

### Size and texture of volcanic ash

Volcanic ash particles range in size from less than 2 micrometers to several centimeters in diameter. The fine particles, known as volcanic dust, can remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended periods, while the larger particles, referred to as volcanic lapilli, fall back to the ground closer to the eruption site. The texture of volcanic ash can be gritty, abrasive, and powdery, with a wide variation in particle shape and composition.

### Dispersion of volcanic ash in the atmosphere

Once volcanic ash is ejected into the atmosphere, it can be transported over long distances by wind currents.
