## Understanding Volcanoes

### What are volcanoes?

[Volcanoes are geological](https://magmamatters.com/geothermal-energy-and-its-volcanic-origins/ "Geothermal Energy and Its Volcanic Origins") features that are formed when molten rock, gases, and debris escape to the Earth's surface, resulting in eruptions of lava and ash. These eruptions can vary in intensity and can have significant impacts on the surrounding environment.

### How are volcanoes formed?

Volcanoes are primarily formed at sites along plate boundaries, hotspots under the Earth's crust, or rift zones where the Earth's tectonic plates are moving apart. The movement of these tectonic plates creates intense pressure and heat, causing the molten rock to rise to the surface and form a volcano.

### Different types of volcanoes

There are several different types of volcanoes, each with its own unique characteristics. Some of the most common types include stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, and [cinder cone](https://magmamatters.com/the-birth-of-new-land-understanding-cinder-cones/) volcanoes.
