# Volcanoes have enthralled humankind for millennia. These [fiery mountains](#fiery-mountains) dominate landscapes as symbols of Earth's dynamic nature. In this guide, we unravel [volcano science](#volcano-science) - how volcanoes form, erupt and transform environments, associated hazards and what they reveal about our planet.

## The Allure of Fiery Mountains

Volcanoes constitute surface vents where molten rock (magma) and volcanic gases ascend from [Earth's interior](#earths-interior) and erupt. Underground magma reservoirs feeding volcanoes derive from partial mantle melting zones 100-200 km deep.

## The Science of Volcanoes

There exist several [varieties of volcanoes](#volcano-varieties) based on morphology and eruptive style. They outline boundaries between tectonic plates and the convecting mantle, occurring at convergent, divergent and hotspot plate boundaries. Their activity regulates [planetary heat flow](#planetary-cooling), shaping surface geology.

### Types of Volcanoes

Shield volcanoes feature broad, gentle profiles built from fluid lava flows. Stratovolcanoes look steeper, with alternating eruptions of sticky lava and pyroclastic debris. [Cinder cone](https://magmamatters.com/the-birth-of-new-land-understanding-cinder-cones/) volcanoes constitute small versions constructed from scoria and ash.

### Eruption Diversity

Eruptive style varies enormously according to magma chemistry, gas content and vent shape. Effusive eruptions eject flowing lava while Strombolian eruptions cause powerful, explosive bursts. Cataclysmic [supereruptions](#supereruptions) discharge surging columns of ash kilometers into the air.

### Planetary Cooling Mechanisms

Volcanic eruptions can cool global temperatures for years. Explosive eruptions inject sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, increasing reflection of sunlight. Fresh [volcanic rock also scrubs atmospheric carbon dioxide](https://magmamatters.com/geothermal-energy-and-its-volcanic-origins/ "Geothermal Energy and Its Volcanic Origins") via silicate weathering.

## Spotlights on Earth's Interior

As surface expressions of Earth’s interior, volcanoes provide insights into geological processes within the planet. Analyzing erupted magmas reveals conditions like temperature and composition at their deep subterranean [magma sources](#magma-sources). Tracking hotspot trails outlines the structure of underlying mantle convection.

## Cataclysmic Supereruptions

While smaller eruptions are more common, volcanic systems occasionally produce absolutely colossal “supereruptions” that impact global climate and landscapes on vast scales. Unfathomable outpourings of over 1000 km^3 of pyroclastic material bring catastrophe to wide areas in what are Earth’s most violent paroxysms.
