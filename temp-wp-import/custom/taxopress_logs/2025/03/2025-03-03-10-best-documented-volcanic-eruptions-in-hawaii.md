## Kilauea Eruption (1983-now)

### Overview of Kilauea Volcano

Kilauea Volcano is one of the most active and well-known volcanoes in Hawaii. Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, it is part of the larger Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Kilauea is a shield volcano, which means it has a broad, gently sloping shape formed by layers of lava flows. The volcano has experienced countless eruptions throughout its history, with the most recent eruption starting in 1983 and continuing to this day.

### The start and evolution of eruption

The 1983 eruption of Kilauea began with the opening of a fissure on the volcano's eastern rift zone. Lava spewed out from this fissure, creating new volcanic vents and causing destructive lava flows. Over the years, the eruption has gone through several phases, with periods of increased volcanic activity and periods of relative quiet. The lava has covered large areas of land, including residential areas and infrastructure, changing the landscape of the island.

### Magnitude and impact of eruption

The magnitude of the Kilauea eruption is remarkable. It has been one of the longest-lasting eruptions in recorded history, with a continuous flow of lava for over 30 years. The volume of lava produced during the eruption is estimated to be over 1 billion cubic meters. The impact of the eruption on the surrounding environment and communities has been significant. Lava flows have destroyed homes, roads, and vegetation, forcing the relocation of residents and impacting the economy of the affected areas.

### Documentation and study of eruption

The ongoing eruption of Kilauea since 1983 has provided scientists with a unique opportunity to study and document the behavior of an active volcano. Researchers from around the world have flocked to Hawaii to observe and collect data on various aspects of the eruption. This includes [monitoring seismic activity](https://magmamatters.com/the-art-and-science-of-volcano-monitoring/ "The Art and Science of Volcano Monitoring"), gas emissions, and the movement of lava flows. The information gathered from studying the Kilauea eruption has contributed to our understanding of volcanic processes and helped improve volcano monitoring and hazard assessment techniques.

## Mauna Loa Eruption (1984)

### General information on Mauna Loa

Mauna Loa, also located on the Big Island of Hawaii, is another active volcano with a prominent place in Hawaiian history. It is the largest volcano on Earth in terms of volume and has a similar shield-like shape to Kilauea. Mauna Loa has a long history of eruptions, with the most recent major eruption occurring in 1984.

### Initiation and progression of eruption

The 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa began with a series of small earthquakes, indicating the movement of magma beneath the volcano. The eruption started with the opening of fissures on the volcano's northeastern flank, releasing lava fountains and flows. The lava reached populated areas, prompting evacuations and causing extensive damage to infrastructure.

### Magnitude and consequences of eruption

The eruption of Mauna Loa in 1984 was significant both in terms of the volume of lava erupted and its impact on nearby communities. Approximately 97 million cubic meters of lava were erupted during the event, covering an area of around 75 square kilometers. Fortunately, there were no direct fatalities caused by the eruption due to timely evacuations. However, the eruption resulted in the destruction of homes and agricultural land, as well as the disruption of transportation and utilities.

### Records and research on eruption

The eruption of Mauna Loa in 1984 was closely monitored by scientists, providing valuable data for volcanic studies. Seismic monitoring, gas measurements, and satellite observations were used to track the eruption and understand its dynamics. Researchers also studied the effects of the eruption on the surrounding environment, such as changes in air quality and the long-term impacts on vegetation.
