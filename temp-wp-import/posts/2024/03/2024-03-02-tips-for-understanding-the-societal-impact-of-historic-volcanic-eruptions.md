## Understanding Eruption Types and Their Impact

### Differentiating between explosive and effusive eruptions

When it comes to volcanic eruptions, there are two main types: explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions occur when the magma is highly viscous and contains a high amount of gas. These eruptions are characterized by violent explosions, sending ash, gases, and volcanic bombs into the air. On the other hand, effusive eruptions occur when the magma is less viscous and has a lower gas content. In such eruptions, the lava flows steadily out of the volcanic vent, rather than being explosively ejected. Understanding the differences between these two eruption types is crucial in assessing their potential impacts on surrounding areas.

### Correlating eruption types with societal impact

The type of eruption can have a significant impact on the surrounding society. Explosive eruptions tend to be more destructive and can cause widespread devastation.
