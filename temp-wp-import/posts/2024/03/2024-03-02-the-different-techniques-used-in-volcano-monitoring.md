## Seismic Monitoring

Seismic monitoring plays a crucial role in [understanding volcanic](https://magmamatters.com/understanding-volcanic-formation-a-comprehensive-guide/ "Understanding Volcanic Formation: A Comprehensive Guide") activity. By using seismometers, scientists can record the earthquakes induced by volcanoes. These earthquakes are typically caused by the movement of magma beneath the Earth's surface. Seismometers detect the vibrations and ground movements associated with these volcanic earthquakes, providing valuable data about the underground activity.

Low-frequency earthquakes, in particular, are analyzed to track and monitor the inflating magma within a volcano. These earthquakes occur as magma rises and causes the surrounding rocks to fracture. By closely analyzing the characteristics and patterns of these low-frequency earthquakes, scientists can gain insights into the movement and behavior of magma, which can help in predicting and understanding volcanic eruptions.

Another important aspect of seismic monitoring is the detection of harmonic tremors. Harmonic tremors are continuous, rhythmic ground motions that are associated with the movement of magma. By analyzing the frequency and intensity of harmonic tremors, scientists can gain valuable information about the movement of magma beneath a volcano. This helps in assessing the potential for an impending eruption and understanding the dynamics of volcanic activity.

## Gas Measurements

Monitoring gas emissions from volcanoes is another important technique in volcano monitoring. Two major gases that are monitored are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases are released by volcanoes during eruptions and can provide important insights into volcanic activity.

Sulphur dioxide emissions are monitored as it is a key indicator of volcanic activity. By measuring the amount of SO2 being released, scientists can assess the intensity of volcanic eruptions and the potential for further activity. Continuous monitoring of SO2 levels helps in early detection of volcanic unrest and the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.

[Carbon dioxide emissions are also monitored](https://magmamatters.com/the-art-and-science-of-volcano-monitoring/ "The Art and Science of Volcano Monitoring") as they can provide valuable information about the magmatic activity beneath a volcano.
