## Understanding Volcanic Hazards

Volcanic hazards pose significant risks to communities living near active volcanoes. It is crucial to understand the types of volcanic hazards that can occur to effectively prepare and mitigate their impact.

### Types of volcanic hazards

Volcanic hazards can include lava flows, pyroclastic flows, volcanic ashfall, volcanic gases, lahars (mudflows), and volcanic tsunamis. Lava flows are streams of molten rock that can destroy everything in their path. Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving, hot, and deadly clouds of gas, ash, and rock fragments. Volcanic ashfall can blanket large areas, causing respiratory issues and damaging infrastructure. Volcanic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, can be poisonous and cause respiratory problems. Lahars are fast-moving mudflows that can occur when volcanic ash mixes with water. Volcanic tsunamis can be generated by volcanic eruptions underwater.

### The role of geography in volcanic hazards

The geographic location of a volcano plays a significant role in determining the type and severity of volcanic hazards. Volcanoes located along plate boundaries, like those in the "Ring of Fire," are more prone to explosive eruptions, resulting in pyroclastic flows and volcanic ashfall.
