## Understanding Earth's Carbon Cycle

To appreciate the part volcanoes play, it's important to first get a grip on Earth's carbon cycle itself. This cycle is a complex system where carbon atoms continuously move through the atmosphere, oceans, and land. From the gentle exchange of [carbon dioxide](https://magmamatters.com/understanding-the-hazards-of-volcanic-gases/ "Understanding the Hazards of Volcanic Gases") between ocean surfaces and the atmosphere, to the decay of plant matter that returns carbon to the soil, this cycle is the heartbeat of life on Earth.

### Components of the Carbon Cycle

Here's where the magic happens: carbon moves in various forms across different reservoirs, some of which include:

- **Atmosphere**: Carbon exists mainly as [carbon dioxide](https://magmamatters.com/carbon-dioxide-emissions-natures-clue-to-volcano-monitoring/ "Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Nature's Clue to Volcano Monitoring") (CO2) in the air.
- **Oceans**: Vast amounts of carbon are stored as dissolved CO2.
- **Biosphere**: Plants, animals, and soil harbor [significant](https://magmamatters.com/tag/significance/ "Significance") quantities of carbon.
- **Lithosphere**: [Carbon is stored in Earth's crust](https://magmamatters.com/understanding-the-impact-of-volcanic-gases-on-earths-crust/ "Understanding the Impact of Volcanic Gases on Earth’s Crust"), often as carbonates and fossil fuels.

The balance of carbon in these reservoirs keeps our climate stable, influencing everything from global temperatures to [sea levels](https://magmamatters.com/tag/sea-level/ "Sea level").

## Volcanoes and Carbon Emissions

Volcanoes are notorious for their dramatic eruptions and rivers of [molten lava](https://magmamatters.com/the-relationship-between-volcanoes-and-climate-change/ "The Relationship Between Volcanoes And Climate Change"), but they're also stealthily contributing to carbon emissions. Despite their reputation for destructive power, these geological features have been quietly exchanging [carbon with the Earth's atmosphere](https://magmamatters.com/the-role-of-volcanoes-in-earths-carbon-cycle-8/ "The Role Of Volcanoes In Earth’s Carbon Cycle") for millions of years.

### How Volcanoes Release Carbon

When [volcanoes erupt](https://magmamatters.com/the-relationship-between-volcano-eruptions-and-rock-types/ "The Relationship Between Volcano Eruptions and Rock Types"), they release carbon dioxide trapped in magma. This [process](https://magmamatters.com/tag/processes/ "Processes") is volcanic degassing. Even when not [erupting](https://magmamatters.com/tag/eruptions/ "Eruptions"), volcanoes continue to seep gases through vents and fumaroles, contributing to the atmospheric carbon pool albeit more subtly.

#### Table: Estimated Annual CO2 Emissions from Volcanoes

| Type of [Emission](https://magmamatters.com/tag/emissions/ "Emissions") Estimated CO2 Emission (Million Metric Tons per Year) |
| --- |
| Eruptive | 100 to 150 |
| Non-eruptive | 300 to 450 |

These figures are surprisingly modest when compared to human-related CO2 emissions, which soar into the tens of billions of metric tons each year.

## The Role of Volcanoes in Geological Carbon Sequestration

While [volcanoes](https://magmamatters.com/tag/volcano/ "volcano") are certainly carbon emitters, they contribute significantly to carbon sequestration over geological timescales. This dual [role](https://magmamatters.com/tag/role/ "Role") is often overlooked but is essential for maintaining our planet's long-term carbon balance.

### The Cycle of Weathering and Sedimentation

Volcanoes, through their eruptions, create new [rocks that eventually erode through weathering processes](https://magmamatters.com/the-10-best-examples-of-volcanic-feature-erosion-over-time/ "The 10 Best Examples of Volcanic Feature Erosion Over Time"). When these rocks break down, they react with CO2 in the atmosphere, forming carbonates which are washed into the oceans. Here, they settle as sediments, [effectively trapping carbon](https://magmamatters.com/the-invisible-dangers-volcanic-gases-and-their-impact/ "The Invisible Dangers: Volcanic Gases and Their Impact") away from the atmosphere for millions of years.

This process, known as long-term carbon sequestration, highlights how [volcanic activity intricately links to geological processes](https://magmamatters.com/plate-tectonic-boundaries-and-volcanic-activity/ "Plate Tectonic Boundaries and Volcanic Activity"), where each role played is crucial.

## Volcanoes vs. Human Emissions: A Comparison

So, how do [volcanic emissions](https://magmamatters.com/tag/volcanic-emissions/ "Volcanic Emissions") stack up against our human-induced outputs? It's tempting to point fingers at [volcanoes](https://magmamatters.com/tag/volcanos/ "Volcanos"), given their fiery outbursts, but the truth paints a different picture.

### Human Influence on Carbon Output

Modern industrial [activities have vastly overshadowed natural volcanic emissions](https://magmamatters.com/the-impact-of-volcanic-emissions-on-climate-change/ "The Impact of Volcanic Emissions on Climate Change"). We are burning fossil fuels, clearing forests, and altering [landscapes](https://magmamatters.com/tag/landscape/ "Landscape") at an unprecedented rate.

| Source of [Emission CO2](https://magmamatters.com/tips-for-improving-accuracy-in-predicting-volcanic-activity/ "Tips for Improving Accuracy in Predicting Volcanic Activity") Emissions (Billion Metric Tons per Year) |
| --- |
| Fossil Fuels | ~38 |
| Deforestation | ~4.5 |
| Volcanoes (average) | ~0.5 |

It's clear that our collective [carbon footprint dwarfs volcanic emissions](https://magmamatters.com/the-role-of-volcanoes-in-earths-carbon-cycle-9/ "The Role Of Volcanoes In Earth’s Carbon Cycle"). Addressing human-driven carbon release is crucial for mitigating [global warming](https://magmamatters.com/the-role-of-volcanic-gases-in-global-warming/ "The Role of Volcanic Gases in Global Warming") and climate change.

## A Historical Perspective: The Role of Volcanoes Through Time

Volcanic activity has interacted with Earth's carbon cycle in myriad ways over [geological timescales](https://magmamatters.com/top-5-volcanic-landmarks-in-the-geological-time-scale/ "Top 5 Volcanic Landmarks in the Geological Time Scale"), from the creation of new landmasses to mass extinction events. Understanding these [historical](https://magmamatters.com/tag/historical/ "Historical") contexts provides insights into their longstanding influence.

### Major Volcanic Events

- **The Great Dying (Permian-Triassic Extinction)**: Occurring over 250 million years ago, this was [Earth's most severe extinction event](https://magmamatters.com/how-volcanic-rocks-reveal-earths-hidden-history-3/ "How Volcanic Rocks Reveal Earth’s Hidden History"), during which massive volcanic eruptions contributed to a spike in atmospheric CO2, dramatically altering global climates.
    
- **The Deccan Traps**: Around 66 million years ago, immense [volcanic activity in present-day India influenced](https://magmamatters.com/the-influence-of-volcanic-activity-on-species-formation/ "The Influence of Volcanic Activity on Species Formation") the environment possibly coinciding with the extinction of the dinosaurs.
    

These and other [volcanic activities show that while volcanoes](https://magmamatters.com/exploring-the-biodiversity-around-active-volcanoes-6/ "Exploring The Biodiversity Around Active Volcanoes") can introduce substantial amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, they also play roles in geological transformations that influence climate and life.

## How Scientists Study Volcanic Contributions
